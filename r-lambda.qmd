## Safe Data Tech: Validation Server 

* **Use Case**: Safely expand access to confidential data through a “validation server” that implements a computationally intensive differential privacy algorithm.

* **Solution**: Built a system to run thousands of analyses in parallel and return privacy-preserving results back to the user. This system is also “serverless” – meaning we only pay for the servers while they are computing results.

## Extension: Data Collection 

* **Use Case**: Every month, researchers check various websites to see if agencies published new data files. If so, they download the data and compute summary statistics.

* **Solution**: Built a system to automatically run R scripts each month, download data files to AWS storage, and then send emails with links to the CSV files.
